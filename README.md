- Python 3.8+
- 8GB RAM (minimum)
- 20GB available storage

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Celebrum/PaQBoT_Base.git
cd PaQBoT_Base
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
./cloud-setup/install-dependencies.sh

## Architecture

PaQBoT consists of several key components:

- **PaQBoT Engine**: Core analysis and decision-making system
- **Harbor Integration**: Secure container registry
- **MindsDB Connector**: AI-powered analytics
- **Content Filter**: Real-time package validation
- **Trust Service**: Quantum-enhanced security verification

## Configuration

The system can be configured through the `harbor.yml` file. Key configuration sections include:

- Database settings
- Security policies
- Content filtering rules
- MindsDB integration
- Quantum security parameters

Example configuration:
```yaml
paqbot:
  engine_url: "http://paqbot_engine:5100"
  database_url: "postgresql://paqbot_user:password@paqbot_database:5400/paqbot"
  content_filtering:
    enabled: true
    cache_ttl: 3600
    block_unknown: true
```

## API Documentation

The PaQBoT API is available at:
- Engine API: `http://localhost:5000`
- Web Interface: `http://localhost:8050`

Documentation for specific endpoints will be available at `/docs` when the server is running.
